General Overview/Structure of the Tutorial:

1. Start with some basic terminology we use when talking about loops
   - Picture from Loop Fusion presentation
   - other terminology
2. Loop simplified/canonical form
3. Rotated loops
4. Loop Closed SSA form
5. Auxiliary data structures


General Guidelines
- Give examples whenever possible
- Provide commands being used whenever possible



Questions
- Live demo?
- Evolving example so you have a working loop optimization at the end of the
tutorial
  - Use this example to illustrate several aspects of loop optimizations
    - Both things that work, and things that do not work
- If we do a live example, what all do we want to include in it:
  - Pass manager - which one?
  - Loop opt pipeline or plugin?
  - Preserves Analysis
    - Updating data structures like DomTree, SCEV, etc.
- Work off of fixed LLVM release for reproducability (i.e., LLVM 9)?
- Feedback on success/failure
